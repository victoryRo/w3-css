    <h2>Overflow: visible</h2>

    <p>By default, the overflow is visible, meaning that it is not clipped and it renders outside the element's box:</p>

    </div>
    <hr>

    <h2>Overflow: hidden</h2>

    <p>With the hidden value, the overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content is hidden:</p>

        (even if you do not need it):
